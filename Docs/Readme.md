# Drone Force One

**AI-Coordinated Emergency Drone Swarm**  
Backpack-deployable, high-velocity rescue system for search, rescue, and rapid supply drops in comms-dead or disaster zones.

Part of the Avalon Reconciliation & Prosperity Zone self-healing infrastructure pilots (NLRPA Month 18–24)

## Vision
A lone first responder carries a compact 5–10 kg backpack. In a disaster (wildfire, flood, building collapse), one-button deploy launches 8–15 modular drones.  
Inspired by the Guinness World Record **Peregreen 3** (585 km/h bursts), high-velocity variants achieve 300+ km/h for lightning-fast coverage while executing **Archimedean spiral patterns** with onboard LIDAR and thermal imaging to locate survivors in rubble or obscured terrain.

Coverage: **1–2 km radius in under 2 minutes** – life-saving speed for Northern and Atlantic communities.

## Core Features
- **Backpack-Launchable Swarm**: Up to 15 nested modular drones (compact carbon frames, auto-deploy in <10 seconds).
- **Specialized Roles**:
  - 1 thermal scout (victim detection)
  - 1 signal repeater (Starlink uplink for comms-dead zones)
  - Remaining drones: high-speed spiral mapping + med-pod/supply drops
- **High-Speed Emergency Mode** (Guinness-Inspired):
  - Peregreen 3-level thrust (brushless 5000kV motors, lightweight props, LiPo bursts)
  - Archimedean spirals (r = a + bθ) for optimal, gap-free search
  - LIDAR (100k pts/sec) + thermal → AI flags survivors and relays encrypted coordinates
- **AI Coordination**: Firefly-inspired agents handle pathfinding, collision avoidance, prioritization, and swarm decisions.
- **Hardened Comms**: Integrates **Sat-Shield** repo (anti-jam, quantum-resistant Kyber encryption).
- **Support Vehicle**: Reinforced F-350 utility truck for resupply, mobile command, and swarm expansion.
- **Future Extensions**: Consumer/pet-monitor drones optionally join the swarm.

## Reconciliation & Sovereignty Impact
Dene-led innovation for Indigenous Guardians, remote communities, and disaster response. Aligns with the **Avalon Joint Decision-Making Council Charter** (self-healing infrastructure pilots) and protects cultural sites during emergencies.

Open-source MIT license – gifts for communities. No paywalls, just resilience.

## Tech Stack (Prototype)
- Raspberry Pi 5 swarm controller
- Python + NumPy (spiral math), Pygame (simulations)
- Brushless motors, carbon frames, LiPo power
- Future: Full integration with Sat-Shield encryption and Nakehko Net mesh

See `high_speed_spiral.py` for Archimedean spiral simulation.

## Call to Action
Fork, fund, or collab.  
These aren't hobbies – they're prototypes for reconciliation and life-saving sovereignty.  
Seeking $25k–$250k non-repayable for hardware builds, pilots, and scaling (Indigenous Guardians, CanNor, Ulnooweg, ACOA).
