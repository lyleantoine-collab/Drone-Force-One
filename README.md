# Drone Force One

**AI-Coordinated Emergency Drone Swarm**  
Backpack-deployable rescue system for search, rescue, and supply drops in comms-dead disaster zones (wildfires, floods, missing persons).

**100% Dene-owned Indigenous Tech** | Developed by Lyle Antoine – Full-Status Dene | Goulds, NL  
GitHub: github.com/lyleantoine-collab  
Part of open-source resilience prototypes for Northern and Atlantic communities.

## Vision
One-button deploy from a compact backpack launches 8–15 drones. High-velocity Archimedean spirals with LIDAR/thermal cover 1–2 km radius in under 2 minutes. Roles: scouts detect, boosters relay signals, haulers drop supplies.

Extends to Hive Truck (F350 mod) for 5km+ range in remote areas.

## Core Features
- **Backpack Swarm**: <10s deploy, modular carbon frames.
- **High-Speed Mode**: 300+ km/h bursts, Archimedean/Fibonacci paths.
- **AI Coordination**: Mode-specific (flood, wildfire, etc.) via SwarmCoordinator.
- **Hardened Comms**: LoRa mesh + satellite uplink.
- **Payload Drops**: Mode-tuned supplies (e.g., life vests, meds).
- **Open-Source MIT License**: Community gifts, no paywalls.

## Reconciliation & Impact
Dene-led tools for Indigenous Guardians and remote SAR. Protects cultural sites, empowers communities.

## Simulations (Proof-of-Concept)
- `sims/hive_truck_sim.py`: Truck deploys boosters + scouts with signal chain.
- `sims/payload_drop_sim.py`: Detects victims, queues drops.
- `sims/swarm_demo.ipynb` / `swarm_demo.py`: Interactive spirals + thermal pings.

Run simulations to see coverage and detection in action.

## Tech Stack
- Python + NumPy/Matplotlib (sims)
- Raspberry Pi baseline
- ArduPilot/MAVLink ready
- Future: Sat-Shield encryption integration

## Call to Action
Seeking $25k–$250k non-repayable grants for hardware prototypes and pilots (SAR NIF, ACOA, CanNor, PSIB streams).
