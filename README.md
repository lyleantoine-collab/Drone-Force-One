# Drone Force One

**AI-Coordinated Emergency Drone Swarm**  
Backpack-deployable system for search, rescue, and supply drops in remote disaster zones.

**100% Dene-owned Indigenous Tech** | Lyle Antoine, Full-Status Dene | Goulds, NL  
GitHub: github.com/lyleantoine-collab  
Open-source prototypes for Northern/Atlantic resilience.

## Vision
Rapid deploy of 8–15 drones for 1–2 km coverage in 2 minutes using high-speed spirals, LIDAR/thermal.

Hive Truck extends range to 5km+ for remote SAR.

## Features
- Modular roles: scouts (detect), boosters (relay), haulers (drop).
- AI: Mode-specific (flood, wildfire) via SwarmCoordinator.
- Hardened comms: LoRa + satellite.
- Open-source MIT software.

## Impact
Dene-led SAR tools for Indigenous Guardians, cultural protection.

## Simulations
- hive_truck_sim.py: Truck deployment with boosters.
- payload_drop_sim.py: Victim detection + drops.
- swarm_demo.ipynb/py: Spirals + pings.

## Tech Stack
- Python/NumPy for sims.
- Raspberry Pi baseline.
- ArduPilot/MAVLink compatible.

## Call to Action
$25k–$250k grants for prototypes (SAR NIF, ACOA, CanNor, PSIB).
